D And,5 reviews,"I booked a car for a destination but had a 16 year old girl we needed to drop on the wayexactly on the way not off the route at all , I am a new customer and didn't realise that would be a problem the driver refused to stop on the way even though I apologised and offered to pay extra, he said to book another car but that he would not do the job as he was tired, I explained that this young girl could be stranded but he still said no, he was very rude, I cannot recommend Bolt to anyone after that experience and am extremely disappointed, we had to order a different taxi so feel we should have received a refund appalling",18-Dec-22

Tom,1 review,"My Bolt driver demanded cash from us for the lift we had booked, claiming we booked a certain type of cab and not the other.
He drove us to a cash machine and made us take out an extra twenty and give it to him.
Overall, what was advertised as a £90 trip ended up being closer to £160 when you take in the new journey cost and the extra fare.
Would never have taken the journey with him having known that. He made us feel very uncomfortable and pressured, and I am now down over 150 for around 50 minute drive (admittedly on New Years). The driver made a point of saying we wouldn’t be able to get any other cabs and that he was our only option, so we better pay up.
Bolt customer service have been extremely unhelpful, refusing to refund me for the money demanded by their employee.",1-Jan-23
Maria M,1 review,"The drive took me to another address and did not listen to me. Apparently their map is wrong, I showed the address on google maps on my mobile phone, but he denied to drive me to my destination and dropped me off somewhere else far from it! Bolt support does not help me as well.",30-Dec-22
Luke Thurston,2 reviews,"Charged me double!

Awful company took my girlfriend and I to Liverpool from Manchester. When we checked the bill we were charged twice the amount and looking into it the driver charged us for his journey home. We spoke to bolt who wouldn’t refund us, only credit our bolt account, which is no good as we have no intention of using them again. Luckily enough due to their greediness the amount bounced, and I cancelled my card so they won’t get the money. Karma- this company will be bust soon hopefully",28-Dec-22
Rohit Pradeep,1 review,The price for the trip was £115 while I was trying to book. How did the price increase to £176 after completing the trip?. No response from customer service.,1-Jan-23
Manjinder Rai,3 reviews,The worst driver and the worst customer service. Thought I’d use it as it was cheaper than Uber. But never again I will use their services. Charged me twice. And a waiting charge?? He was parked elsewhere even though I put the correct address on my app. He was like I’m following what it says on the app. He was being very rude and aggressive towards me. I’d rather pay a bit more to use Uber than this scum of a company!! They don’t deserve the one star either !!!,27-Dec-22

Emma,1 review,"Scam! The driver asked me to cancel the ride and pay cash after the Bolt app wouldn't let us modify the address or restart a new ride. I cancelled and paid cash only to see that Bolt app charged me anyway and are refusing to pay me back after I'm asking for a refund. Just lost customers, 100% do not recommend to anyone.",9-Dec-22
Yulia Komarova,3 reviews,"Fraudulent. Appaling service from both drivers and customer service. Hardly speak any English, rude, negligent, unhelpful and dismissive. When I complained to customer service they made false accusation and suspended my account within 24 hours, blocked my efforts to liase the problem. Pure fraud to avoid responsibility for lousy service which led to jeopardising safety of the rider. Kept my money and refused to return",20-Dec-22
Lewis K,12 reviews,We needed a cab ride to the pub and back. First cab cancelled after waiting 3 minutes. We were charged full fare. Needed a cab to get back. Cancelled again after 4 mins. We were charged £100 for absolutely nothing. We will never use bolt again and advise you to do the same.,27-Dec-22
Miklós Bendegúz Gergye,12 reviews,"I use Bolt once in a month in Budapest and sometimes in other cities/towns in foreign countries. I like the application it's easy to use. Also, the fares are affordable. In peak times, it's very hard to find a driver through the application, probably they don't have enough drivers. I feel also bad, because they cancelled the Bolt Food in Hungary.",10-Dec-22
Karthikeyan,3 reviews,"Since we have to put 1 star minimum, I am keeping it. We ordered some snacks out little child. Delivery guy marked the order as delivered and nevered delivered. When I contact the support , they said it is wrongly marked and the order will be delivered in 5 minutes . After 10 minutes both delivery guy and bolt support ghosted me for ever",26-Dec-22
Elizabeth,14 reviews,"Only time I used them the driver drove away after asking us to put the bag in the boot. I asked if he could not do it for us as we were carrying heavy backpacks already, he said ""book another car then"", got on the car and left. Absolute unnecesary rudeness",22-Dec-22
Ilona Sliacina,1 review,"Absolutely fraudulent.
Why would someone charge you if your driver can’t find where you’re waiting?(happened sometime ago)
Also, they shouldn’t take extra money,if longer route was selected.
Tried to ask drivers directly,why this happens with Bolt,they blame poor app, company itself,so on..but in my opinion it’s their (driver’s) attitude and lack of respect to customers.
Disgusting service",23-Dec-22
Tia,6 reviews,"I am so sick and tired of drivers cancelling at the last minute, this causes such stress especially during the nursery run. My latest driver left within the free waiting period despite me having messaged to say that I was coming. I was right behind him and saw him drive off. The app does not make customer interaction easy therefore customer service is poor. I feel for any elderly person trying to use these apps with such dire commitment from some of the drivers and lack of customer service from Bolt!",21-Dec-22
Valerie Tooke,2 reviews,"Ordered a ride with them yesterday ( Xmas Eve ) supposed to of waited 9 minutes, the car came, same name and model, but it wasn’t for us! It was for an upstairs neighbour! Ours was waiting in a completely different location! Went on to live chat and the driver said to check pick up point, I gave him my address and post code again. I rang up the dispatch people only for them to say it had been cancelled! The ride should of cost £11, when I looked it was £12, it kept £6 and was refunding me £6! My grandson and myself were left outside in the rain with all our Xmas presents, they said they didn’t have any spare cars, I had a crutch as well. Useless company and a big big let down! Shame on you bolt!!!!!",25-Dec-22

Dasha Bushujeva,1 review,"I’m highly disappointed with how careless bolt is towards their customers. I work night shifts and some locations are bad for public transport so I have to get a cab. I searched for a cab in my area three times and the app couldn’t find me a driver so I decided to change locations and walked for a while and tried two more times. On the third time I gave up and asked a friend to pick me up at 2am. This happen on the 21st of December, can someone please let me know why all now I don’t have my £77 in my account? I don’t understand how can I get charged when a cab haven’t accepted my ride and on top I get charged 5 times without getting my cab. And now I have to wait 12 business days to get my money back. And when I explained this to bolt support team, they completely dismissed the message. Previous ride with bolt, a driver was driving reckless and damaged few of my items from my shopping and they offered me 0.75p for the inconvenience. In the future I’d rather pay extra to use Uber and know I won’t be treated so poorly.",28-Dec-22
